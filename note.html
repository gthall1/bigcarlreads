						<h2>So many things I'd like to say</h2>

						<p>I screwed up.</p> 

						<p>I didn't handle any of this the right way.</p>

						<p>I hate the way this has turned out. I hate the way we never discussed things in a sober or non-emotional state. I hate that I was brash, stubborn, and selfish. And, honestly, I kinda hate gossip girl, although the second season was a little better than the first.</p>

						<p>I immaturely pattern-matched our situation to my past relationships and tried to come up with the best solution I could. I realize, for the both of us, that our pasts complicate things. I had no business being in San Francisco, and I never intended to be.  You were absolutely right, for the both of us, and it's still stunning to think I could have pushed for something different.  You were consistent and I should have listened instead of trying to force things.  I should have communicated better.  It turns out we wanted the same thing and we couldn't ever discuss it without a meltdown.</p>

						<p>I want to know you're ok.  I want to hear your voice.  I want to see that little smile you do where you press your lips and don't show your teeth...I think it's like number 5 of your 7 smiles.  I don't want to smell your under-the-covers farts.  And most of all I want to know that you're happy and everything is going great for you.</p>

						<p>I don't know exactly what I want right now, I don't know what's best, and I don't know how to move forward or the best solution.  But one thing I do know with absolute certainty...</p>

						<p>I miss you.</p>
